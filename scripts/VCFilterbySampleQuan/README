# VCF Filter by Sample Quantity
This tool is counting the samples that are characterized by the presence of a SNP or whatever the line describes and the samples that do not. Then if those numbers are over the threshold, keeps the line/SNP to a different file. 
By the end, three files will be created. Two of them containing information about the summaries and one containing the final vcf file, which satisfies the threshold.

```
Usage: VCFilterbySampleQuan.py [options]
Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v FILE, --vcf=FILE   VCF for statistics
  -t NUMBER , --threshold=NUMBER
```

#### VERSION CHANGELOG
