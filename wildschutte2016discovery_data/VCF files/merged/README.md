HERVK.vcf - contains the data from all populations from 1000 genome project
HERVK.fixed.vcf - contains the same data as HERVK.vcf, but refIns insertions have been inverted (0/0 -> 1/1 , 1/1 -> 0/0). We did that,
because we wanted 0/0 to mean that none haploids contain the insertion and 1/1 to mean that both of the haploids contain the insertion.
